- In this paper, previous work is extended to support more aspects of PYTHON language.
- Other algorithms are also studied - DynaMOSA,MIO and MOSA
- Improved regression assertion generation and evaluated
- Evolutionary algorithms outperform Random test generation
- DynaMOSA like for Java yields better coverage in Pyhton
- But other remaining issues - like type information still linger and have impact on the effectiveness of the algorithms
