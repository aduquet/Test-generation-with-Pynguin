-> how it generates the test case values
-> what tool it uses to get the coverage metrics
-> WHy are we replicating ? Empirical study
-> RQ3 -> problem: How they can mutPy inside the tool.
-> IN RQ3 he used only DynaMosa
-> Pg- 38 ->
-> Not  only look for coverage but how strong are the testcases generated by the other three alogrithms
-> One type of programs

->pg -  39

-> 100 coverage means 100% 

-> DId pynguin finds exactly these bugs mentioned in the codebases
 -> These projects had these exact bugs
 -> Mutation versions
 -> Find bugs, do mutation testing on the fixed versions
